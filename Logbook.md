## [2026-02-07 07:51] AEP - PR #43 (Narrative Text Decoupling) ✅
**PR:** https://github.com/guillermopr94/adventure-forge/pull/43  
**Status:** 🔄 OPEN  
**Branch:** `fix/fe-34-narrative-text-without-image`  
**Issue:** Closes #34 [P0] - Narrative text hidden if image missing

### Problem
Game-breaking bug where narrative text was completely hidden when segment images failed to load or were delayed. Root cause: Early return in `useEffect` (line 343-347) prevented text rendering when `!currentSegment.image`.

### Solution Implemented
- ✅ **Decoupled text display from image loading:** Text ALWAYS renders, regardless of image status
- ✅ **Fallback placeholder:** Animated shimmer effect (`<div className="image-placeholder">`) when image missing
- ✅ **User notification:** Toast message ('🖼️ Image loading...') on first segment without image
- ✅ **Accessibility:** Next button (click-to-advance) remains functional even without images

### Technical Changes
- **Game.tsx** (18.3 KB):
  - Removed early return that blocked text rendering
  - Added `isImageMissing` state to track image loading status
  - Conditional rendering: `{isImageMissing && !currentImage && <div className="image-placeholder">...}</div>}`
  - Reset `isImageMissing` when image loads successfully
- **Game.css** (+59 lines):
  - `.image-placeholder`: 450px height, dark gradient background
  - `.shimmer-effect`: Animated highlight sweep (2s infinite)
  - `.image-loading-text`: Pulsing emoji + text with fadeIn animation
  - Responsive: 300px height on mobile (<480px)

### Build Status
- ✅ **SUCCESS** (75.89 kB main bundle, +0.1% size increase acceptable)
- ⚠️ ESLint warnings: 11 total (no new warnings introduced)

### Testing Checklist
- ✅ Build passes without errors
- ✅ Shimmer animation renders when `currentSegment.image === undefined`
- ✅ Text overlay displays with typewriter effect regardless of image
- ✅ Click-to-advance works even when placeholder is showing
- ✅ Toast notification appears once per game session start

### Next Steps
- Await code review & merge
- Update DASHBOARD.md post-merge
- Mark #34 as CLOSED

## [2026-02-04 01:30] AEP Turn - Structured Game State
**Issue:** #1 - Structured Game State via Gemini Tool Calling
**Status:** ✅ Completed

### Technical Actions
1. **Backend Enhancement (API):**
   - Updated `AiService` to support Gemini's `responseMimeType: 'application/json'`.
   - Implemented `generateGameTurn` method in `AiService` with a robust schema-enforced prompt and fallback strategy (Gemini 2.0 → Gemini 1.5 → Pollinations).
   - Added JSON extraction logic for non-native providers (Pollinations).
   - Refactored `GameService.streamTurn` to use structured data, removing legacy `[PARAGRAPH]` and `[OPTIONS]` token parsing.
   - Added support for `inventory_changes` and `stats_update` in the streaming protocol.

### Verification
- `npm run build`: SUCCESS (Backend).
- Schema validation: Prompt explicitly defines `paragraphs`, `options`, `inventory_changes`, and `stats_update`.
- Fallback logic: Verified cascade from Gemini to Pollinations with JSON enforcement.

### Next Steps
- Implement frontend UI components to display `inventory_changes` and `stats_update` (#1 - Frontend).
- Optimize assets and cleanup hook dependencies (#7).
- Implement Authentication Guard and Resource Ownership (#6).

## [2026-02-04] AEP Turn - Backend Security & Auth Integration
**Issue:** #6 - Backend Security: Implement Authentication Guard & Resource Ownership
**Status:** ✅ Completed

### Technical Actions
1. **Backend Security Implementation:**
   - Created `AuthGuard` in `src/auth/auth.guard.ts` to validate Google ID Tokens via `AuthService`.
   - Applied `@UseGuards(AuthGuard)` to `GameController` and `AiController`.
   - Refactored `GameController` to extract `userId` from the authenticated request (`req.user.googleId`) instead of relying on client-provided body/query parameters.
   - Updated `AuthModule` to export `AuthService` and configured `GameModule` and `AiModule` to import it.
2. **Frontend Authentication Integration:**
   - Updated `AuthContext.tsx` to store and expose the Google ID Token (`token`) in state and `localStorage`.
   - Modified `GameService.ts` to include the `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header in all requests.
   - Updated `Game.tsx`, `MainMenu.tsx`, and `LoadGameModal.tsx` to pass the authentication token to the service.
   - Enhanced `useGameStream` hook and `AudioGenerator` to include the Bearer token in fetch/SSE calls.

### Verification
- Backend `npm run build`: SUCCESS.
- Frontend `npm run build`: SUCCESS.
- Security: All sensitive routes (`/game/*`, `/ai/*`) now require a valid Google Token. Resource ownership is enforced by using the token's subject as `userId`.

### Next Steps
- Implement frontend UI components to display `inventory_changes` and `stats_update` (#1 - Frontend).
- Optimize assets and cleanup hook dependencies (#7).
- AI Infrastructure: Model Fallback & Exponential Retry improvements (#3).

## [2026-02-04] IUQA Turn - Story Generation Flow Audit
**Protocol:** Intensive UX & QA Audit (IUQA)
**Status:** ✅ Audit Completed & Critical Bugs Fixed

### Identified Issues
1. **[CRITICAL BUG] History Wipe:** `Game.tsx` was removing all model messages from history every turn.
2. **[CRITICAL BUG] Narrator Dead:** `TextNarrator` was conditioned on `actualContent` which was never set.
3. **[UX BUG] Double Advance:** Sentences were being advanced twice.
4. **[VISUAL BUG] Sync Logic:** Broken `while` loop with immediate `break` in `advanceCinematicSegment`.

### Technical Fixes
- **History Preservation:** Refactored `setGameHistory` to correctly update/append model responses.
- **Narrator Restoration:** Replaced `actualContent` with `currentSentence`.
- **Cleanup:** Simplified `advanceCinematicSegment` by removing the non-functional redundant wait loop (handled by `useEffect`).

## [2026-02-04] AEP Turn - Core Story Flow & History Fixes
**Issue:** #9 - [CRITICAL] Game History is wiped every turn | #10 - Double Advance | #11 - Visual Sync
**Status:** ✅ Completed

### Technical Actions
1. **Backend History Fix (API):**
   - Refactored `AiService.generateGeminiText` to use native Gemini `contents` array for history instead of manual string concatenation.
   - Added duplication check to prevent the current prompt from appearing twice in the context window.
   - Improved role mapping for both Gemini and Pollinations providers.
2. **Frontend UX & Sync (Game.tsx):**
   - **History Preservation:** Verified that `setGameHistory` uses functional updates and `prev.slice` to update model chunks without wiping history.
   - **Double Advance Prevention (#10):** Introduced `isAdvancingRef` and `currentSentenceIndexRef` to lock transitions and prevent race conditions when clicking during an auto-advance.
   - **Visual Sync (#11):** Refactored `useEffect` for cinematic segments to correctly wait for stream-updated images before initializing sentence playback.
   - **Index Management:** Added explicit ref-based tracking for `currentSentenceIndex` to ensure state consistency across asynchronous timeouts.

### Verification
- **Backend Build:** SUCCESS.
- **Frontend Build:** SUCCESS (Verified locally via tsc).
- **Issue Tracking:** Issues #9, #10, #11 addressed.

### Next Steps
- Implement frontend UI components for `inventory_changes` and `stats_update` (#1 - Frontend).
- Optimize assets and cleanup hook dependencies (#7).

## [2026-02-04] AEP Turn - Robust Voice Initialization
**Issue:** #12 - [UX] Game initialization hangs if voices fail to load
**Status:** ✅ Completed

### Technical Actions
1. **Frontend Resilience (Game.tsx):**
   - Added `console.log` tracking for `speechSynthesis` events to improve remote debugging.
   - Refactored `updateVoices` to handle empty voice arrays gracefully.
   - Enhanced the safety timeout (2s) to force `setVoicesLoaded(true)` even if the `voiceschanged` event never fires or returns no voices (common on mobile browsers/Android WebView).
   - This ensures the game always proceeds to `startGame()` instead of hanging on a loading state.

### Verification
- **Frontend Build:** SUCCESS (Verified production build via `react-scripts build`).
- **Logic Check:** Verified that `setVoicesLoaded(true)` is guaranteed by the timeout, unblocking `initializeGame()`.

### Next Steps
- Implement frontend UI components for `inventory_changes` and `stats_update` (#1 - Frontend).
- Optimize assets and cleanup hook dependencies (#7).
- Resilience: Exponential Retry logic for API calls (#20).

## [2026-02-04 13:50] AEP Turn - Resilience & Retry Logic
**Issue:** #20 - [RESILIENCE] GameService lacks error handling & retry logic
**Status:** ✅ Completed

### Technical Actions
1. **Utility Creation:**
   - Created `src/common/utils/resilience.ts` containing a `withRetry` helper with exponential backoff.
   - The helper handles transient errors (429, 5xx, timeouts, network issues) and skips non-retryable ones (400, 401, 403, 404).
2. **Service Integration:**
   - Refactored `src/common/services/GameService.ts` to use `withRetry` for all Axios calls (save, load, list, delete).
3. **Hook & Component Integration:**
   - Updated `src/common/hooks/useGameStream.ts` to retry the initial stream connection fetch.
   - Enhanced `src/views/Game/Game.tsx` to retry backend audio generation requests via the `AudioGenerator` service.

### Verification
- **Frontend Build:** SUCCESS (Verified production build via `react-scripts build`).
- **Logic Check:** Verified that each retryable operation will attempt up to 3 times (or 2 for non-critical) before failing, improving UX in spotty network conditions.

### Next Steps
- Implement frontend UI components for `inventory_changes` and `stats_update` (#1 - Frontend).
- Optimize assets and cleanup hook dependencies (#7).
- UX: Image Loading Placeholder / Shimmer (#17).

   - Verified `.env` is in `.gitignore` (already present).
   - Confirmed `.env` was never committed to git history (`git log --all --full-history -- .env` returned empty).
2. **Developer Experience Enhancement:**
   - Created `.env.example` with placeholder values for `REACT_APP_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`.
   - Added comprehensive "Local Development Setup" section to `README.md` with step-by-step OAuth configuration instructions.

### Verification
- Git history audit: SUCCESS (no .env in history).
- Documentation review: Clear setup instructions for new developers.
- PR #24 created and ready for merge.

### Next Steps
- Implement frontend UI components for `inventory_changes` and `stats_update` (#1 - Frontend).

## [2026-02-04 16:35] AEP Turn - Typewriter Effect for Cinematic Overlay
**Issue:** #2 - Dev Environment Restoration & Cinematic Engine Foundation (AC4)
**Status:** ✅ AC4 Completed

### Technical Actions
1. **TypewriterText Component:**
   - Created `src/common/components/TypewriterText/TypewriterText.tsx` with:
     - Configurable speed (characters per second).
     - Character-by-character text reveal via `useState` + `setTimeout`.
     - `onComplete` callback for sync with audio/game flow.
2. **Integration:**
   - Updated `Game.tsx` to import and use `TypewriterText` in the cinematic text overlay.
   - Text now reveals progressively instead of rendering instantly.

### Verification
- `npm run build`: ✅ SUCCESS.
- Bundle Impact: +179B gzipped (0.2% increase - minimal).
- Visual: Character-by-character reveal synchronized with overlay fade-in.

### PR
